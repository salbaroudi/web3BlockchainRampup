## Introduction:

This project made to follow along with practical tutorial made by Dapp University, found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3681ZYbDSSk).

The goal of the project was to set up a basic voting app, with a local block chain testing environment.

In the end, about 75 percent of the application was finished - upto the point of
viewing our candidate results with our web front end. As the codebase was designed in 2018, some portions of code had to be modernized as the Ethereum stack of technologies has changed significantly in 3 years.

I was able to do this with the first portions of the code, but it became
very tedious in the end.  I could not get browser events to work correctly (dead front end).

## What was learned?

The basic technology stack to launch a project was demonstrated:

- **Truffle:** Provided template code (Pet Shop Code Base), for our Election App.
- **Ganache:** Simulated a local Ethereum Blockchain, for our testing purposes.
- **NPM:** Used to manage our node.js packages, and run our lite-server for front end testing.
- **MetaMask:** Allows our browse to interact with our local Blockchain.

I made highly detailed Latex notes as I went along. See the Included PDF for details.

## What is next?

After diving into the code, it became immediately obvious that more advanced
programming concepts needed to properly understand code, and model real world business requirements.

Spending time to understand event+asynchronous programming, and promises in JavaScript is a necessary requirement for these kinds of applications.

Even writing unit test cases for these projects is done in Javascript - hence it is
essential to spend time becoming familiar with modern advancements in the language.

**Next Steps:** Leet Code, Dapp and JavaScript tutorials.

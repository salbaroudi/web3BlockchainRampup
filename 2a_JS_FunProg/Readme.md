## Introduction:

The purpose of this course was to understand the basics of functional programming,
and how it is mainly used in JavaScript.

This folder contains code for the tutorials and exercises I performed during the
course. Some of the main learning points are below:

For a summary of what I learned, see the notes PDF document in this folder.

### Main Course Content:


1) Notions of Functional Programming: Pure functions, avoidance of shared state and mutations,
side-effects

2) Control Flow: Reduce, Map and Filter Functions as a replacement for imperative looping structures, Ternary operators instead of IF statements.

3) Functional Composition: Pipe and Compose functions, Currying. General code patterns for the currying of a chain of functions, utilizing pipe.

5) Higher Order functions, scope and closure, argument binding.

6) Functional Programming Libraries: Lodash and Ramda

7) Comparison to other Programming Methods (OOP, Declative)

# Minimial Create React App

This is a stripped down version of our create-react-app based Portfolio.

Note: At the time of development, this course project needed a classProperties plugin for Babel to
work correctly.

As this learning project is being run a year after the course was made - these experimental features
are now standard in Babel - so no patch is needed to get the project working.

The .babelrc is not included in this project instance.

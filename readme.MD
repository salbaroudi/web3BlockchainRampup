## Introduction:

The purpose of this project folder is to document my progression of work in
learning about Blockchain technologies.

### My Starting Point:

At the beginning, I had some experience with Blockchain technologies:

1) Usage and interaction with various Blockchains (as a speculator),
including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avax, Polygon and Monero chains.

2) Some theoretical study of the technologies behind Bitcoin and Ethereum -
by reading the Mastering Ethereum and Bitcoin books (Antonopoulos et al.)

3) Some understanding of Tokenomics, including whitepaper reviews
for API3, Ocean, Dai and other small to mid-cap projects.

4) Previous coding experience - but not directly related to Blockchain.

5) University background in Computer Science and Physics (BSc. level).

### My Goal:

To reach an advanced level of technical understanding for Blockchain technologies,
eventually gaining employment and building my own projects from scratch.

## Progression:

A summary of each stage in my learning is below:

0a) Udemy: Website Hacking and Penetration Testing:


1) **UDapp's Election Contract Tutorial:** Setup basic development stack (NVM,
  Ganache, Truffle, Atom). Completed about 75 percent and realized I needed
  more understanding of Javascript promises.

2a) **Udemy Functional Programming in JS:** Learn and practice functional programming
techniques - a mainstay for modern JavaScript programming.

2b) **Udemy Asynchronous JS and Promises:**:

3) **Practical JavaScript Projects:**

4a) **Udemy: Website Hacking and Penetration Testing:** Penetration Labs (Kali Linux), Remote and Local Vulnerability exploitation, SQL Injections, vulnerability discovery tools.

4b) **Udemy: Anonymous Browsing:** Survey and practical course on anonymous browsing, I2P, Tor and setting up proxy chains.
